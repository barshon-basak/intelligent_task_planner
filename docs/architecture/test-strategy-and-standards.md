# Test Strategy and Standards

*   **Approach:** Test-driven, especially for the `Scheduling Engine`, which requires 90%+ unit test coverage.
*   **Pyramid:** Strong focus on Unit and Integration tests.
*   **Frameworks:** `pytest` and `pytest-django`.
*   **Infrastructure:** Django's test client with an in-memory SQLite database for test runs.
