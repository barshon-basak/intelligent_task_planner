# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Intelligent Task Planner, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for this modern, HTMX-driven fullstack application.
