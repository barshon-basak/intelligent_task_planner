# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Deliver a functional, responsive web application that meets all defined MVP requirements within the 4-week timeline.
*   Reduce student stress and planning overhead by providing an automated, intelligent scheduling solution.
*   Ensure the application is intuitive and valuable, targeting a System Usability Scale (SUS) score above 80.
*   Meet all non-functional requirements for performance (â‰¤ 2s schedule generation), reliability (99% uptime), and scalability (up to 500 concurrent users).

### Background Context

The Intelligent Task Planner project aims to solve the common problem of inefficient and stressful manual planning faced by university students. By creating a specialized web application, we will provide a tool that moves beyond simple to-do lists into the realm of automated time management. The system will process a student's tasks, deadlines, and available time to generate an optimized weekly schedule.

This PRD defines the requirements for an MVP inspired by the simplicity of tools like TickTick but tailored for academic needs. The core of the MVP is a robust, rule-based scheduling engine, with a progressive enhancement path to include optional AI-driven suggestions via the OpenRouter API.
