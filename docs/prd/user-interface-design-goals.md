# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The user experience will be clean, intuitive, and efficient, drawing inspiration from the simplicity of modern productivity tools like TickTick. The primary goal is to minimize cognitive load for the user by providing a clear, visually organized schedule that is easy to understand at a glance. The interface should feel empowering, transforming the complex task of academic planning into a manageable and even engaging process.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

*   **Drag-and-Drop:** Core to the user experience will be the ability to manually adjust the schedule by dragging, resizing, and splitting task blocks directly on the calendar view.
*   **Visual Status Management:** A Kanban board will provide a clear, tactile way for users to update task status.
*   **Interactive Conflict Resolution:** The "Sacrifice Mode" will be a highly visual, interactive overlay that allows users to resolve scheduling conflicts by physically dragging a new task over existing ones.

### Core Screens and Views

*   **Landing Page:** A professional, welcoming page that clearly communicates the application's value proposition.
*   **Dashboard / Kanban View:** The main user hub, displaying tasks in "To Do", "In Progress", and "Completed" columns.
*   **Weekly Calendar View:** A visual representation of the generated schedule, showing time-blocked tasks for the week.
*   **Pomodoro Timer View:** A dedicated, focused interface for the Pomodoro sessions.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application will adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA as a target, ensuring it is usable by students with disabilities, with a focus on keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

### Branding

The visual identity will follow a modern, clean aesthetic called "Focused Calm," featuring both light and dark themes. The design will utilize soft colors, rounded corners, and a refined glass morphism effect for key cards and modals, with a vibrant yet professional color palette.

**Implementation & Aesthetic Reference**
*   **Primary Reference:** The **`front-end-spec.md`** document is now the definitive source of truth for the application's aesthetic.
*   **Tech Stack Adherence:** The implementation **must** adhere to the project's official tech stack (Django Templates, TailwindCSS, HTMX, AlpineJS).
*   **Design Rules:** Developers must implement the design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.) as defined in the `front-end-spec.md` and configure them within the `tailwind.config.js` file to achieve a UI that is visually and experientially identical to the new design direction.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The application will be a single responsive web application, providing a seamless and consistent experience on both desktop and mobile browsers.
