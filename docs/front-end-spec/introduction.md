# Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the **Intelligent Task Planner**'s user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

**Target User Personas**
*   **Primary:** University students (undergraduate and graduate) who are tech-savvy but time-poor, seeking to reduce the cognitive load of managing a complex academic schedule.

**Usability Goals**
*   **Clarity:** The user should understand their schedule at a glance.
*   **Efficiency:** Core actions like adding a task or rescheduling should be fast and intuitive.
*   **Empowerment:** The user should feel in control of their time, not managed by the tool.

**Core Design Principles**
1.  **Aesthetic Integrity:** The final product must be a faithful implementation of the "Focused Calm" design system defined within this document, featuring a clean aesthetic, soft shadows, and refined glass morphism.
2.  **Simplicity First:** Prioritize a clean, uncluttered interface. Every element on the screen must serve a clear purpose.
3.  **Progressive Disclosure:** Show only what is necessary for the current context, revealing more complex options as needed.
4.  **Immediate Feedback:** Every user action (a click, a drag-and-drop) must result in an immediate and clear visual response.
